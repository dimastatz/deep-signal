## Overview
With the pervasive adoption of cameras and microphones, coupled with the surge in remote communication via video and audio calls, the volume of multimedia data is rapidly expanding. This trend underscores the critical importance of video and audio analysis across diverse sectors, including healthcare, finance, and education. Recognizing this need, the Deep Signal framework emerges as a solution, aiming to provide centralized, real-time analysis of multimedia data. 

- Deep Signal, leveraging [Apache Spark's](https://spark.apache.org/) robust infrastructure, simplifies scalable processing and analysis. It ensures smooth integration across different programming languages and provides accessible tools for developers to extract valuable insights from multimedia sources. These tasks range from analyzing sentiments in customer service calls to categorizing content in video streams.

- While Apache Spark excels in handling structured data through Spark SQL, [DataFrames](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py), and [Datasets](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala), its support for unstructured data, such as text, is also strong with [RDDs](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/RDD.scala). However, when dealing with media data (binary), developers are left to navigate on their own. They lack support for essential operations like speech-to-text conversion, translation, speaker diarization, and object detection.

- To bridge this gap, Deep Signal introduces new interfaces, namely MediaRDD and MediaDStream. These interfaces provide a user-friendly approach for working with distributed collections of media data, enabling ease of use, scalability, and advanced functionality when processing video and audio files.


## Deep Signal Concepts
Deep Signal introduces two new objects to Apache Spark - MediaRDD for Batch processing and MediaDStream for Streaming. MediaRDD is an extension of Apache Spark's RDD, designed for handling distributed media files efficiently. It streamlines operations like speech-to-text conversion, audio file translation, speaker diarization, and more within the Spark framework. This specialized support simplifies multimedia processing tasks for developers.

MediaDStream is an extension of Apache Spark's DStream designed for handling media streams like video and audio. It simplifies the real-time processing and analysis of continuous media data within Spark's streaming framework. With MediaDStream, developers can easily ingest, process, and analyze streaming media content in real-time. It offers specialized functionalities for tasks such as object detection, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis as data flows in. MediaDStream integrates seamlessly with other components of the Spark ecosystem, enabling the development of end-to-end multimedia processing pipelines.
